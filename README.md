# RADCompanionApp (VR Input Tool)
 
## What is this?
This is a tool that connects your iphone to a RAD Application as a second controller. Or a single controller when you dont have an one available. Just connect to your local IP and calibrate it to begin using. Use the touch screen as a trackpad, or press virtual buttons.

## Networking
This uses the UDP socket layer in order to send JSON data back and forth.
